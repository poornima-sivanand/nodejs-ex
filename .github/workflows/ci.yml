# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named OPENSHIFT_SERVER_URL with the value of your OpenShift server URL.
# 
# 2. Set up another secret named API_TOKEN with the value of a valid token to authenticate to OpenShift.
#
# 3. Change the values for the PROJECT and APP_NAME environment variables  (below).
